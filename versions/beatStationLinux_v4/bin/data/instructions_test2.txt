Please use SPACEBAR to tap to the beats. In addition to the beats, you can tap on the 'samas' (start of the tala cycle) using the key S. Please try to use both the keys for tapping. Use the PLAY button to play and NEXT button to move to the next song. On your right, you will see an image and a short description explaining the structure of the tala of the current excerpt that is playing. You can use that information to improve your tapping of beats and the samas. If you are not satisfied with your tapping, you can replay the excerpt and tap again. You can listen to each excerpt atmost twice. We record only your final tapping response for each excerpt.
